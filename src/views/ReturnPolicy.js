					<h2>Standard Return Policy</h2>
					<p>
						no refunds . Return for replacement or exchange within: 30 days .
					</p>

					<h2>Standard Return Policy Overview</h2>
					<p>
						You may return merchandise purchased from Slangin Sound and Tint for
						a replacement, provided that the procedures and requirements are
						followed. All returns require a return merchandise authorization
						(RMA) number. An RMA number must be issued within 30 calendar days
						after the date of purchase. An RMA number is valid for 14 calendar
						days after it is issued.
					</p>

					<h2>Replacement Terms</h2>
					<p>
						A processing fee of 10 percent will apply to the value of
						merchandise returned. We will only apply the value of the
						merchandise returned, not the shipping cost. On items with free
						shipping returned for a replacement, the original shipping cost that
						we paid the shipping courier will be deducted from your credit. We
						will send a product replacement for an authorized return following
						the completion of receiving and inspection at our facility. The
						replacement will ship within four business days following our
						receipt of your return (excluding weekends and national holidays).
						We do not send advance replacements or replacements before we
						receive and inspect the returned merchandise.
					</p>
					<p>
						To receive a replacement quicker, you may place a new order for the
						same item (shipping not included), and we will issue a refund for
						the full value of the returned product (excluding the processing fee
						and shipping), upon completion of our return process.
					</p>

					<h2>Exchanges</h2>
					<p>
						If you purchased a product that you wish to exchange for an
						alternate item, you can return the item for a credit towards your
						next purchase.
					</p>

					<h2>Defective Merchandise</h2>
					<p>
						Merchandise that is discovered to be defective upon receipt will be
						replaced. No fee will be assessed if we are permitted to resolve the
						issue by replacing your defective merchandise.
					</p>

					<h2>Damaged Merchandise</h2>
					<p>
						All packages are inspected for damage prior to leaving our
						warehouse. If your merchandise is damaged during shipment by the
						shipping courier, please contact us immediately as we must be
						informed within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt for all
						damage/shipping related claims. Damaged merchandise can be replaced
						with the same model only.
					</p>

					<h2>Return Shipping</h2>
					<p>
						Return shipping cost (the cost to send merchandise back to our
						store) is comparable to your cost of driving to any store for
						returning an item, which is not reimbursable. Therefore, we do not
						reimburse any return shipping cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						If an item you received is defective, we will definitely replace the
						item with a new one; however, we do not cover or reimburse the
						shipping cost for returning defective merchandise back to our store.
						We will ship the replacement product to you at our cost, and use
						every good measure to ensure that the replacement order is processed
						quickly.
					</p>

					<h2>Returning Items</h2>
					<p>
						Please call (480) 396-9003 to receive an RMA number. You will be
						required to complete our product return form which will also provide
						helpful instructions for your return.
					</p>
					<p>
						All returned merchandise must be in original condition, and must
						include the original factory box (UPC bar codes and serial numbers
						must be intact) and factory packaging (e.g. foam, plastic,
						wrappings, etc.), peripherals (e.g. battery, charger, cords, straps,
						etc.), included warranty cards (without markings), and all
						instruction booklets and paperwork. The RMA number or any other
						inscriptions must not be written or printed on the product box or
						packaging. We will not process the return if any of these conditions
						are not followed.
					</p>
					<p>
						To locate the nearest shipping outlet, you may contact the following
						carriers:

					<ul>

						transit is solely the shipper's responsibility (which is you when
						you return a product to us). It is important to save the tracking
						information and to properly insure all merchandise being returned to
						Slangin Sound and Tint.
